The Arduino Gimbal Project aimed to develop a stabilizing device capable of providing smooth camera movements along three axes: pitch, roll, and yaw. The primary objective was to utilize an MPU6050 sensor in conjunction with servos to achieve automatic stabilization. 
This involved processing gyroscope data to counteract unwanted movements, thereby maintaining a steady camera orientation. The project also incorporated manual control via a potentiometer, allowing for user intervention to adjust the yaw axis as needed. 
A visual feedback mechanism was integrated using an LED to indicate operational status and potentiometer activity, enhancing the user interface and providing immediate feedback on the system's state.
