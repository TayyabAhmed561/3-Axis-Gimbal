The 3-Axis Gimbal project aimed to develop a product that could stabilize a camera or object regardless of how the user moved the device. With multiple servo motors and the MPU6050 sensor, which was used to calibrate and utilize the gyroscope and the accelerometer, the device could provide smooth camera movements along the three axes: pitch, roll, and yaw. The main objective was to counteract any movement, essentially keeping the object fixed in its place. Furthermore, I had also incorporated manual control via a potentiometer, allowing user intervention to adjust the yaw axis as needed. With a switch, you could alternate between automatic and manual mode. Lastly, an LED was integrated to indicate operational status and potentiometer activity, providing immediate feedback on the system's state.
